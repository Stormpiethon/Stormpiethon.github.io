            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome! I'm Alexander Brittain, a recent graduate from the University of Advancing Technology (UAT) with a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence, and a Bachelor's degree in Advancing Computer Science. I'm passionate about helping technology and observations of nature overlap. A future where technology and humanity are enhanced by a strong foundation of exploration and philanthropy is worth working to create.
            </p>

            <p>
                I worked in the service industry for over 15 years before deciding to pursue my passion for technology. I learned the basics of how a business works, how to deal with people (customer and coworker alike), professional communication techniques, sales techniques, teamwork, urgency, organization, and leadsership skills during my time working in restaurants. I'm excited to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems and contribute to the advancement of technology as well.
            </p>
